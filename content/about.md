The Monero Punks workgroup was started as a way to rally the builders in the Monero community and provide an effort to truly showcase their work.

There are many individuals and organizations out there building tools and services but their contributions get lost in the noise since the largest social gatherings (Reddit, Twitter) mostly discuss price, trading, marketing, art, and stickers (hype). Additionally, there aren't many good places where tools and services are being aggregated; [getmonero.org](https://getmonero.org) shows mostly merchants. There's not much detail around the general projects and tools being developed in the ecosystem for those with the inclination to tinker.

For now, we can be found at the following places on the web:
* `#monero-punks` on [Libera Chat](https://libera.chat), IRC network
* `forum.moneropunks.org` - [Forum](https://forum.moneropunks.org) ([Onion Link](http://gay6icg34lq4jjzgjw2fof5gj3pqzvakniwbufk23vhq4fdof4r223qd.onion))
